            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Version Control systems are utilized in recording changes in code, data or documents. This is so that these versions can be returned to later as needed. Also permanent changes made to the file can be merged with a saved final draft of the changes stored on a separate server. Version control can also be useful for larger scale projects in which a 
            team would need to collaborate in real time 24/7. A VCS allows colleagues to see who made changes and where, this helps to separate tasks into manageable chunks where each member could work on code at different times.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Many companies have their varieties of version control systems but nobody does it like GitHub. GitHub takes the perspective of viewing data as snapshots instead of a list of file-based changes that most other VCS companies implement. The benefits of this snapshot style of storage make it so it’s almost like you have your own miniature file system. This different style of data 
            storage management allows for quicker access to previous file states without even leaving the local disk. Because Git doesn’t need to go to a separate server to access previous files, GitHub users are at a huge advantage when working on files anytime anywhere.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository essentially a directory or folder used for storing project data. This data can be anything you wish to work on and manage. Pictures, word documents, text files, software files, etc. can all be stored in the repositories. Fundamentally, any knowledge worker can gain from using a system of 
            repositories. But repository makes it sound much more complex than it actually is so users have given repositories the nickname repo for short. There are two types of repos, local and remote, and when both are utilized effectively together GitHub magic happens.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">First we are going to talk about the local repository. This is the repository on your computer that exists as a folder containing your files and requires no internet connection to user. The local repo is where virtually all of the development takes place. By containing your work in a local repo, you can work on multiple versions of a project before you are ready to release it to the world or your team for review.
            Eventually after enough testing and debugging, the files in your local repo can be merged with a final ‘draft’ that serves as a completion point for that section of the work. This completion point is where we recognize our next topic, remote repositories.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Once the next step of a project is complete and ready to be merged with a previous state of the project you should upload it to a remote repo. This remote storage space exists online in a host like GitHub or another data storage server.
            This remote storage local will reflect the files most up to date completed form. While others may be making additions to the project they are not yet merged and complete, so we considered the remote repository as a final draft per se. In the case of GitHub, these files are accessible by all other users unless otherwise specified.</p>
